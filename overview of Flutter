Flutter is a UI toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses the Dart programming language.

To get started with Flutter, you need to:

Install Flutter: Download and install Flutter from the official Flutter website (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Set up your editor: Use an IDE like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio with the Flutter and Dart plugins installed.

Create a new Flutter project: Run the command flutter create project_name in your terminal to generate a new Flutter project.

Write Dart code: Open the project in your chosen editor and start writing Dart code in the lib directory.

Here's a simple example of a Flutter app:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('My Flutter App'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
